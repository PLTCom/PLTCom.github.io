= Supply Requests


People and organizations that need supplies can request them through the main website at https://odoo.pltcom.org.
Follow the process below to process supply requests for distribution.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For the time being, distribution of the website should be
limited, as we do not have the manpower to handle a large volume of requests. When the NLC infrastructure is fully established, we may be able to advertise the site to the general public.
